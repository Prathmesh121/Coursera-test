<h2>Subheading 1</h2>
<p>CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts.CSS sselectors are used to determine which HTML element, or set of elements to apply the CSS declearations to. The browser uses tos selector API to traverse the DOM or Document ovject Model, and not only for styling using CSS. </p>
<h2>Subheading 2</h2>
<p>That's because a lot of JavaScript libraries out there usr the browser selector API to attach behacior and data to HTML elements. Much in the same way that CSS aplies style to those elements. In this lecture, wr're goung to talk about three diffrent types of selectors, element, class, and id selector</p>
