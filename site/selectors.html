	Combining Selectors is a very powerful technique that allows you to more precisely target dumb elements. In this lecture we're going to take a look at some of the most common ways of combining CSS selectors The first one is with element with class selector. As you can see here we have a P element followed immediately without any spaces by a dot big which is a A class selector. And what this expresses is that I want to target every p element that has an attribute class equal to big.

		Note the lack of space between the element that the class definition. If you do put a space it will mean a completely different combinition so make sure that if you want an element that has a class assigned to a particular value that there's no spaces between the first selector and the second selector in this case vetween the P element selector and the .big class selector.
